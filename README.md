## About
This repository is meant to work as a database to store useful Computer Science related website URLs.

This repository will not restrict itself to a particular CS websites. But it will not include specific articles or one-off pages from a website. A CS website (included on this list) is one that has a strong focus on CS.

## Use Case
These files were developed as templates to allow someone (me mostly) to quickly develop a README.md or web page quickly without much thought.

The true value of these Markdown files is that since they are templates, they can be modified to meet the requirements of any project or web page.

Currently, I am implementing these Markdown files across all of my Github projects.

## Project Inspiration
This project came into being due to me needing a better way to host all of the websites that I have found.
